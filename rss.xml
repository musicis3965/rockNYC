    <link>https://rocknyc.org/</link>
    <description>Mick Fleetwood's beloved Hawaiian establishment, Fleetwood's on Front Street, has tragically been claimed by the escalating wildfires in Maui.

The fires kicked off several days ago, leading to the evacuation of thousands. As the flames advance, 36 individuals tragically lost their lives, with entire neighborhoods reduced to cinders. The origins of this firestorm remain unclear.

Mick Fleetwood, the rhythmic force behind Fleetwood Mac and a long-time Maui dweller, founded Fleetwood's on Front Street in 2012. Addressing the situation, he stated, "Maui and the Lahaina community have been my home for several decades. This is a devastating moment for Maui, and many are suffering unimaginable loss. Fleetwood's on Front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken, our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members."

The restaurant's official channels also reached out, noting, "As most of you know Maui has been dealing with extreme fires created by the residual winds of Hurricane Dora. Lahaina Town has taken the brunt of it. ... Mahalo for your continued thoughts and prayers for our community and our first responders."

Concluding with heartfelt sentiment, Mick Fleetwood shared, "On behalf of myself and my family, I share my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of Maui." Let's not forget other renowned artists like Steven Tyler and Willie Nelson also have roots in Hawaii, and they, too, are feeling the impact.
