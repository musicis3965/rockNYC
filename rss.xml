<h1>Wolfgang Van Halen: Rocking Out of His Dad's Shadow and Into the Mammoth Limelight</h1>

<p>Wolfgang Van Halen, who once rocked the bass with the iconic Van Halen, is now making waves with his own gig, Mammoth WVH. After the legendary Eddie Van Halen passed in 2020, Wolfgang revealed his heart-wrenching tribute "Distance" under Mammoth WVH, setting the stage for their debut album in 2021. And guess what, rockers? Like the legends Dave Grohl and Prince, Wolfgang jammed every instrument on that album! With his latest masterpiece, "Mammoth II", out now and the crew touring alongside Metallica, Wolfgang took a moment with Rolling Stone to drop some wisdom from his Van Halen days.</p>

<p>"With Van Halen, I learned a lot of how I didn‚Äôt want things to be with Mammoth. Why do we need to be walking around on eggshells? Why is there a problem all the time? Like, why can‚Äôt we just get along and play music? Don‚Äôt we all love music enough to put our bullshit aside and actually have a good time having this be our livelihood? Shouldn‚Äôt it be easier than this?" he reflected. Wolfgang's mission for Mammoth? A rock-solid team that's all about the tunes and can ride through any storm. And here's a fun tidbit: Wolfgang might just try his hand at other instruments on stage in the future. Rock on, Wolfgang!</p>

    <title>Mick Fleetwood's Maui Retreat Devastated by Wildfires</title>
    <link>https://rocknyc.org/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[

    
        <p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center;">(Artist Rendering, Not Actual Event)</p>
        </br>
    
    <p>Mick Fleetwood's beloved Hawaiian establishment, Fleetwood's on Front Street, has tragically been claimed by the escalating wildfires in Maui.

<p>The fires kicked off several days ago, leading to the evacuation of thousands. As the flames advance, 36 individuals tragically lost their lives, with entire neighborhoods reduced to cinders. The origins of this firestorm remain unclear.

<p>Mick Fleetwood, the rhythmic force behind Fleetwood Mac and a long-time Maui dweller, founded Fleetwood's on Front Street in 2012. Addressing the situation, he stated, "Maui and the Lahaina community have been my home for several decades. This is a devastating moment for Maui, and many are suffering unimaginable loss. Fleetwood's on Front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken, our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members."

<p>The restaurant's official channels also reached out, noting, "As most of you know Maui has been dealing with extreme fires created by the residual winds of Hurricane Dora. Lahaina Town has taken the brunt of it. ... Mahalo for your continued thoughts and prayers for our community and our first responders."

<p>Concluding with heartfelt sentiment, Mick Fleetwood shared, "On behalf of myself and my family, I share my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of Maui." Let's not forget other renowned artists like Steven Tyler and Willie Nelson also have roots in Hawaii, and they, too, are feeling the impact.
